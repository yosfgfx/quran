# Quran Search

A single-page Arabic Quran search tool. The page loads the entire Quran from [alquran.cloud](https://alquran.cloud/) and lets you search for words or letters.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Make sure the font files remain in the same folder so the custom Yousef fonts load correctly. The page requires an internet connection to fetch the Quran and for Tailwind CSS.

## Fonts

The bundled **Yousef** regular and bold fonts are included under the [SIL Open Font License 1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL). See `LICENSE` for details.
