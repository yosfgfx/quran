# Quran Search App

This is a small static web page that lets you search the full Quran in Arabic. The entire text is loaded from [api.alquran.cloud](https://alquran.cloud/api) on page load, then you can filter verses in real time.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Wait for the Quran to load, then type any word to search.
3. Click a result to view the verse in context.

The page requires an internet connection to fetch the Quran data.

## Fonts

The included `Yousef-Regular` and `Yousef-Bold` fonts are used for all text and headings. They are distributed under the [SIL Open Font License 1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL). Copies of the fonts are stored locally so the page works offline once loaded.
